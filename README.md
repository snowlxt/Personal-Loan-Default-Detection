# Personal-Loan-Default-Detection
By using LendingClub Personal Loan dataset, I conducted this project to detect default by machine learning models.

## Overview
This project will explore the types of customers that default on loans in peer-to-peer lending. This is relevant because on such platforms, lenders are normally at a disadvantage due to information asymmetry: usually, borrowers are more knowledgeable about the risks of the platform than lenders. If borrowers default, lenders, as an individual, bear the consequence and the financial loss themselves, unlike financial institutions, which have procedures and operations in place to mitigate loss. When lenders screen applicants for loan bidding, it is important that they consider factors that affect default rate to make a meaningful and reliable investment. The purpose of this research is to determine the relationships between the default rate of a loan and several customer factors, such as credit score, employment, income, home ownership, and indebtedness. The study will also consider the loan purpose, loan grade and various other pertinent factors. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62194058/136675154-172cc0c7-ffd9-44ce-a70c-e2be1902c165.png)
